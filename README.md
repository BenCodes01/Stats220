Ben Lu is a highly motivated student at the University of Auckland. He is a person of passion, and he created **'Stats220'** so that he could share his love for statistics and data science with everyone.  

There are many reasons why he loves what he loves, but here are a few reasons to hop on the hype train **_Cah Chooh! Cah Chooh!_**:
- Data has untapped potential and could be analyzed for many real-world applications
- Data technologies are reliable to store and manage organisational information
- Data science is a growing trend which would continue to develop and have an impact on our society 

Although he admits that coding is one of his least strong suits, he *secretly* hopes everyone would enjoy their time visiting his work.  
  
Please feel free to take a tour around all the projects he is happy to share.
There will be six projects involving:
1. HTML Webpage
2. Dynamic Reporting System
3. Data Tables
4. Static and Dynamic Visualisations
5. Creating Data from Digital Sources
6. Automated Code-Driven Processes
